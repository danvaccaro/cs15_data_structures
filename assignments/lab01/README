Lab 01: ArrayLists
COMP 15

About: 
This program reads a shopping list from a text file and creates two ArrayList instances: one list containing items to buy, 
and another containing bought items. The user sees the "to buy" items, types in the name of an item, 
and the item is moved from the "to buy" list to the "bought" list. When the user quits, the "bought" list is printed.

Files included:
ArrayList.h, ArrayList.cpp: header and implementation files for the ArrayList class.
main.cpp: main program implementation file. 

Compile this program by running the command "make shop" (without quotes).

Run using "./shop <list_filename>" (without quotes).

This program was built around starter code provided for the assignment.
Some logic was inspired by discussion in the lab session.

The program utilizes the ArrayList type as a data structure. An ArrayList contains a dynamically allocated array
and a count for the number of items in the list, as well as the capacity of the list.
The capacity dynamically adjusts to the number of items in the list to conserve memory.

Known bugs: Not case sensitive.

Time taken: 2 hours
