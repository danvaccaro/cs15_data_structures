Acknowledgements: Thanks to the original authors for the starter code on main
                  and the BSTRee class.

Purpose: This program constructs a binary tree of sorted integers and prints
         them out according to 3 traversal techniques: 
         - in order (left->root->right) 
         - pre-order (root->left->right) 
         -level-order (root->children->descendants)

         It also performs a post-order delete (left->right->root).

Data structures: This program utilizes a Binary Search Tree to store the data.
                 A BST is a sor
                 ted tree of Nodes, where each Node has at most
                 two children. The sort algorithms utilize recursion for in
                 orde.
                 Pre-order utilizes a stack to store and process the root node 
                 for each sub-tree of Nodes in a loop.
                 Level-order utilizes a queue to store and process the child
                 Nodes at each depth level, and loops through the queue until
                 all Nodes have been processed.

Time taken: This took an hour to write.
