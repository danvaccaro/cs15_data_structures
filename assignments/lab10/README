Lab 10: Hash Tables
Written by: Dan Vaccaro
Submitted: 16 April 2023

Funkey is an implementation of a hash table which tests hashing
using two different hash functions. FunkeyTable consists of two hash tables:
one generated using linear probing to handle collisions, and another using 
chaining. It can be seen that using the "good" hash function from the STL
performs a better distribution than the "bad one", with far fewer collisions
observed.
