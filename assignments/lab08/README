Lab 08 - Heaps

3/16/2023

This is an implementation of a heap which reads a list of strings
and sorts them into a min-heap based on alphabetical order. The heap
is then printed to the console.

A heap is a type of binary tree that is stored in an array and 
traversed in level-order across the array. In this way, each node's
children and parents can be identified based on its index - the left
child will always be at position 2 * index, the right child will always
be at position (2 * index) + 1, and the parent (excepting the root) will
always be at position index / 2. 

The two intransients for a min-heap are:
    1. The parent key is always less than its children.
    2. The heap is a complete binary tree that is filled from the left.

A well-behaved heap will perform removals and insertions in O(log n) time.
