Lab 4: Recursion

This program generates a maze of a size input by user and recursively solves 
the maze while counting the number of steps to solve it. It prints the initial
puzzle, the solved puzzle, and the path length to get from start to finish.
Successful paths are marked with '.', walls are marked with 'X', and backtracked
paths are marked with 'b'.

This program utilizes a 2D array representation of a maze, traversed by recursing
from the start position. If a position is open, it is marked with  a 'b'. If that 
position is part of the solution, it is then marked with a '.'. Recursion is
performed in a North-East-South-West pattern until the final position is reached.

and main program.
